This paper proposes an adaptive finite-time preassigned performance control (PPC) approach to solve the attitude control problem of hypersonic vehicles (HSVs) suffering from lumped disturbances. A specific preassigned performance function guaranteeing finite-time stability and small overshoot is presented to constrain the attitude tracking errors. Moreover, a novel synchronous disturbance estimation is presented to build a disturbance observer (DO). Based on the devised preassigned performance function and the information from the DO, an adaptive finite-time preassigned performance controller is devised to solve the attitude control problem. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the validity of the presented algorithm.
