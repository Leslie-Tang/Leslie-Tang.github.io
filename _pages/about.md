Welcome to my homepage! I’m TANG Rugang (汤汝刚), a PhD student of [the Hong Kong Polytecnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/about-polyu/) and [Northwestern Polytecnical University (西北工业大学)](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). I’m excited to share my research, ideas and some of my life with you. My current research interests are multi-agent systems (MAS), reach-avoid differencial graphical (RADG) games and approximate dynamic programming (ADP). If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to reach out.
